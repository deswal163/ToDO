Step 1: Set Up HTML Structure

HTML File:
Create a basic HTML structure with the necessary tags.
Include a <head> section for meta information, title, and possible external stylesheets.

Define Task Input Field:
Use the <input> element with appropriate attributes (e.g., type="text", id, placeholder).
Consider adding a <label> for better accessibility.

Add "Add" Button:
Use a <button> element with an appropriate ID.
Consider adding an icon or visually appealing style to make it user-friendly.

Create Task List Container:
Use a <ul> or <div> to represent the container for displaying tasks.



Step 2: Apply CSS Styling

Style Task Input Field:
Apply styles for better visibility, such as setting a reasonable width, padding, and border.

Style "Add" Button:
Style the button for a clean and intuitive look. Use CSS to enhance its appearance.

Style Task List Container:
Apply styles to the container to make the task list visually appealing.

General Styling:
Implement a consistent color scheme and font family.
Consider using CSS flexbox or grid for a responsive layout.




Step 3: Implement JavaScript Logic

Handle User Input:
Set up an event listener (e.g., addEventListener) to detect when the user submits a new task.

Create Task Object:
Write a function to create a task object with properties like id, text, and completed.

Add Task to List:
Write a function to add a new task to the list, considering dynamically creating list items (<li>).

Update UI:
Implement functions to update the UI dynamically. This includes displaying tasks, marking them as completed, and updating task counts.

Mark Task as Completed:
Implement a function to mark a task as completed. You can use CSS classes or inline styles to visually represent completed tasks.

Delete Task:
Add functionality to delete a task. Consider adding a delete button next to each task.




Step 4: Implement Local Storage

Store Tasks in Local Storage:
Modify the functions that add, complete, or delete tasks to update local storage using localStorage.setItem().

Retrieve Tasks from Local Storage:
Write a function that retrieves tasks from local storage using localStorage.getItem() on page load. Update the UI accordingly.
